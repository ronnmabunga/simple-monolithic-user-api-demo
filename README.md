# Simple Monolithic Express.js User Authentication and Authorization API

## Description

This is a code demonstration of a Monolithic API application built with Express.js, where users can register, authenticate, and verify authorization levels. It includes Swagger API documentation for easy route exploration.

## Features

-   **Swagger API Documentation:** Provides documentation for each route directly accessible via the browser.
-   **Monolithic Code Structure:**
    -   All routes and server logic are defined in a single file (no separate route files or models).
    -   Uses core packages such as cors, dotenv, and express.
-   **User Data Handling:**
    -   User data is stored in a local file (managed using the fs module).
    -   No classes or models are used to define the data format.
-   **Registration and Authentication:**
    -   User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before storing them.
    -   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are generated upon login, provided as Bearer Tokens for subsequent requests.
-   **Authorization Middleware:**
    -   Demonstrates varied responses depending on the user role; different responses if user is, either: an unauthenticated user, an authenticated non-admin user, or an authenticated admin user.

## Sample Registered Credentials

Use these sample users to test the API:

-   **Admin User:**
    ```json
    { "username": "admin", "password": "p@55w0rD" }
    ```
-   **Non-admin User:**
    ```json
    { "username": "U_ser-nam.e", "password": "p@55w0rD" }
    ```

# How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronnmabunga/simple-monolithic-user-api-demo
    cd simple-monolithic-user-api-demo
    ```

2.  Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` File:
    Define the environment variables (like the JWT secret) in the .env file. Example:

    ```env
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PORT=your_port_number
    ```

4.  Run the Server:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

5.  Access Swagger Documentation:

-   Visit <http://localhost:{PORT}/api-docs> in your browser to explore the API routes with Swagger UI.
      - PORT - Port number indicated in the environment variables.

## API Routes Overview

-   **POST /users/register:** Registers a new user.
-   **POST /users/login:** Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
-   **GET /users/admin:** Restricted to authenticated admin users.
-   **GET /users/non-admin:** Restricted to authenticated non-admin users.
-   **GET /users/visitors:** Restricted to unauthenticated users.
